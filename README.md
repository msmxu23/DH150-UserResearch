## 1. Challenges and Solutions Overview 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will help bring those who enjoy listening to music to feel more ease and excited to go to concerts/events, so that they can easily access information and find more about the artists they're interetsed in, whether it be tours, meet & greets, or performances--without having to use more time to go on social media or do more searches elsewhere. Users should find this project website extremely informational, friendly, and be able to purchase tickets to events with ease. This project will hopefully serve to make the community of music listeners, happier and more excited to go and check out more events. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for safety and social belonging because people want to feel invited to be a part of something bigger. A music event website that creates a sense of belongingness will not neglect users social needs and desires, and give the proper information to its users, which affect their general ability to form trust and maintain significant relationships. Humans need to feel safe and welcomed in order to continue and go out more. In this case, it would be an online communinity that becomes a live community. 

### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy this need are the various websites that come across a user when they search online, such as Google. There isn't one website that users specifically go to. Most users try to find the most trustworthy-looking site out of the other sites that are available, which can take some time. 

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations for finding tickets and information about certain events are that some users may not have the social media accounts necessary to access such information, such as not having Instagram, a Facebook, or Twitter. Also, although it is great to have social medias linked, there should be basic information for users to access on a certain website. Users may spend too much time, looking through different websites to find more information that is trustworthy and reasonably priced. Therefore, added functionality and features incorporated in this project will address those needs, welcoming, and flexible to all kinds of music listeners, so they can constantly and quickly use this website and be the go to.  

## 2. Target Users 
### What are the characteristics of users?
Demographics: people who enjoy music, want to experience live music, want more information on events or artists, want to feel security and safety when purchasing tickets
Preferences:users who want to find a welcoming and trustworthy music event community 
Expertise: users would not need a certain level of expertise, it would be efficient but flexible for all kinds of users 

### Where would the users do that activity? 
Users should be able to go on the website/app on their laptop or computer whereever they are. They can plan weeks ahead or find out the latest events, even events on the same day through the search bar or subpages. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To have a good experience finding the tickets and more information on certain concerts, they need to feel safe and connected, and this project will allow them to be in contact with other music listeners and discuss more information on the site.  

## 3. Research Method
The observation methods I used in my research include ethnography and participant observation. 
Ethnographic research involved learning about the culture behind my participant and how she normally searches for information and tickets for an event as a music event goer. 
I observed a participant who fits my target demographic details and asked questions as my participant searched for event/concert information and tickets.

3. Notes/Quotes 

“The name of the concert and the date that it's supposed to be held, and also my location.” 

“I will also look for like the benefits and different seating arrangements that come with it.” 

“I know there's some concerts that are more like interactive where you could actually look at different seats..." 

“But if not, I would go to like a third or second hand seller. For instance, StubHub.” 

“And also it's pretty easy to navigate...They show you different tickets. The map is right there.” 

“I think cuz it's really useful to have like prices on one side, and having the map, next to the prices, because I think sometimes Ticketmaster, they're not able to do that.” 

“…see like the information of the person selling the ticket… just be nice to know where your ticket is coming from” 

“…other deals and just like referrals, um, people that I trust and know.” 

“crazy advertisement all around it.” 

“And I'm pretty sure when you enter that website, you have to click on another link tickle to take investor, and that's just like extras isn't very necessary.” 

 “instant download” 

“...ask someone from that group or ask, you know some of my friends who are also going. If they have information I need.” 

“I think having a lot of good visual… Like having the website look very aesthetic.

## Reflection 
The contexual inquiry process gives the user the freedom to naturally show me how they navigate a certain website and how they find the information they seek. It allowed me to learn from users without telling them what to do, which is helpful to see their struggles or disapprovals. Since the user was able to do what she normally would do to find the infomration, I learned more about the community she refers to, as someone who enjoys attending concerts and buying tickets. Validation is a great feeling but learning new information and opinions inspired me to note to incorporate helpful features that aren't on these websites. I feel as if the participant feels more natural and vocal about how they feel, which is important for me to understand her and empathize with her as a user. This way, I can more easily figure out how to make things more convenient for the music event community. In the future, I would like to study more people through contextual inquiries and pose better questions, and ask more in detail. I also want to see more experienced researchers conduct their interviews and find my own voice when interviewing or working with users.
