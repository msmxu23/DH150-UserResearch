## 1. Challenges and Solutions Overview 
### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will help bring those who enjoy listening to music to feel more welcomed and connected to concerts/events, so that they can easily access information to events and find more information of the artists they're interetsed in, whether it be tours, meet & greets, or performances--without having to go on social medi or search elsewhere.

Users should find this project website extremely informational, friendly, and be able to purchase tickets to these events with ease. This project will hopefully serve to make the community of music listeners, happier and more excited to go and check out more events. 

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity fulfills the userâ€™s basic need for social belonging because people want to feel invited to be a part of something bigger. A music event website that creates a sense of belongingness will not neglect users social needs and desires, and give the proper attention to its users, which affect their general ability to form and maintain significant relationships. Humans need to feel accepted and welcomed in order to continue and go out more often. In this case, it would be an online communinity that becomes a live community. 

### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to satisfy this need are the various websites that come across a user when they search online, such as Google. There isn't one website that users specifically go to. Most users try to find the most trustworthy-looking site out of the other sites that are available, which can take some time. 

### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Certain limitations for finding tickets and information about certain events are that some users may not have the social media accounts necessary to access such information, such as not having Instagram, a Facebook, or Twitter. Also, although it is great to have social medias linked, there should be basic information for users to access on this certain website. Users may spend too much time, looking through different websites to find the most informational, trustworthy, and cheapest place to buy tickets. Therefore, added functionality and features incorporated in this project should address those needs and be welcoming and flexible to all kinds of music listeners, so they can constantly and quickly use this website they would be accustomed to. 

## 2. Target Users 
### What are the characteristics of users?
Demographics: people who enjoy music, want to experience live music, want more information on events or artists, want to feel security and safety when purchasing tickets 
Preferences:users who want to find a welcoming community 
Expertise: users would not need a certain level of expertise, it would be efficient but flexible for all kinds of users 

### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users should be able to go on the website/app on their laptop or computer whereever they are. They can plan weeks ahead or find out the latest events, even events on the same day. 

### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
To have a good experience finding the tickets they need and feeling connected to a community, they can be in contact with other music listeners and chat with each other and discuss more information. 

## 3. Research Method
The two observation methods I employed include participatory observation and ethnographic research.
Ethnographic research simply involves observing how people look for event/concert tickets. 
I conducted participatory observation research with a participant who fits my target demographic details.

## Reflection 
The contexual inquiry process gave users the freeom to naturally show me how they navigate a certain website and how they find the information they seek. It allowed me to learn from users without any bias. Since the user was able to do what he normally would do to find the infomration, I learned more about the community he refers to as someone who enjoys attending concerts and buying tickets. Validation is a great feeling but learning new information and opinions also opened up my view of a website. I feel as if the participant is able to as insightful seeking as they could've been? In the future, I would like to study more on others' contextual inquiries and interviews to pose better questions and see more experienced researchers conduct their interviews.
